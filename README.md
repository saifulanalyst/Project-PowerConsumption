### **Project Description: Power Consumption Forecasting**

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting **power consumption** using time series data. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains multiple variables, including **temperature, humidity, wind speed, and power consumption across different zones**. The project follows a structured approach covering data understanding, preprocessing, model implementation, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

## **1. Understanding the Dataset**
- **Key Features Analysis:**  
  The dataset includes weather-related variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and power consumption data across multiple zones. Unfortunately due to some limitation in SHAP installation, I use alternative tools to analyse data that can help determine the **feature importance** in forecasting energy demand.
  
- **Challenges in Time Series Forecasting:**  
  - **Seasonality & Trends:** Power consumption varies based on seasonal factors, requiring careful trend analysis.  
  - **Missing Values:** The dataset may have missing timestamps, requiring imputation techniques.  
  - **External Influences:** Factors like economic activities and holidays may impact energy usage.

- **Weather Impact on Power Consumption:**  
  - Scatter plots and correlation matrices are used to analyze the relationship between **temperature, humidity, and wind speed** with power consumption.  
  - Findings suggest that **higher temperatures may increase energy demand (e.g., air conditioning usage)**, whereas wind speed has a **lower correlation**.
The dataset contains 52,416 observations with the following key features: a. Datetime is a timestamp for each observation can be utilised for time series analysis and forecasting. By using this variable we can predict, identify trends, seasonality, and patterns over time (e.g., daily, weekly, or yearly cycles).

b. Temperature described in degrees Celsius (e.g., 6.559). It can be useful factor in power consumption, especially for heating and cooling systems. For example higher temperatures may increase cooling demand, while lower temperatures may increase heating demand. Descriptive statistics shows that its Mean = 18.81Â°C, Std Dev = 5.81Â°C, Range = 3.25Â°C to 40.01Â°C. Data seems pretty normal shape.

c. Humidity described in percentage (e.g., 73.8). It can be utilized to measure the efficiency of cooling systems. Additionally, high humidity levels may increase power consumption for dehumidification or cooling. Descriptive statistics shows that its Mean = 68.26%, Std Dev = 15.55%, Range = 11.34% to 94.8%. Data points are dispersed from the center point.

d. WindSpeed recorded in meters per second (e.g., 0.083). Wind speed can influence heating demand in colder climates. It can also be utilized for renewable energy generation (e.g., wind turbines). Wind Speed: Mean = 1.96 m/s, Std Dev = 2.35 m/s, Range = 0.05 m/s to 6.48 m/s, indicates data are normally distributed.

e. GeneralDiffuseFlows may represent distributed energy flows or grid-related metrics. [not sure] It could be relevant for understanding grid stability and power distribution.

f. DiffuseFlows Similar to GeneralDiffuseFlows.

g. PowerConsumption_Zone1, PowerConsumption_Zone2, PowerConsumption_Zone3 are basically three different zones of power consumption patterns. These could be useful for load management and resources allocation forecasting. Descriptive data of powe consumption zones indicated highly varied among each other.

Correlation matrix shows following fetures: Temperature positively correlates with power consumption (Zone 1 (0.44), Zone 2 (0.38), Zone 3 (0.49)). This indicates higher power consumption during higher temperatures, may be due to air conditioning use. Humidity negatively correlates with power consumption (Zone 1 (-0.29), Zone 2 (-0.29), Zone 3 (-0.23)). Higher humidity might be linked to lower energy demand, may be due to moderate temperature effects. Wind Speed has a weak positive correlation with power consumption (Zone 1 (0.17), Zone 2 (0.15), Zone 3 (0.28)). This suggests that wind speed may not significantly impact energy usage. General Diffuse Flows and Diffuse Flows (Solar Radiation) positively correlated with power consumption (0.17â€“0.19) but not strongly. More solar radiation may slightly increase power usage, possibly due to cooling needs. Power Consumption Across Zones strong correlations between zones (0.75 - 0.83), indicating a consistent pattern of electricity usage across areas.
